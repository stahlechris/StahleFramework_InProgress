# StahleFramework_InProgress
This repo holds common scripts I find myself using accross projects. The goal is to let me get started on projects faster by already having some major functionality. I'll be able to access these from wherever I have an internet connection too.
Eventually I want to have multiple frameworks like StahleGenericGameFramework and Stahle2DGameFramework and StahleVRFramework, etc, etc. Also want to have mini unity projects up here too - to showcase a few systems running at a time. Excited!
